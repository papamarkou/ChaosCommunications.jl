# ChaosCommunications

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scidom/ChaosCommunications.jl.png)](https://travis-ci.org/scidom/ChaosCommunications.jl)

The `ChaosCommunications` package provides a framework for simulating chaos-based communication systems.

At the moment the package provides a generic type hierarchy of communication systems and implements the
Chaos Shift-Keying (CSK) system. More functionality and systems will be added to the package.

An example for simulating CSK and its Bit Error Rate (BER) can be found in `examples/csk_example.jl`. This example
demonstrates the main interface of the package.
